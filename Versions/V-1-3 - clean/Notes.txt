Ways to make events 

:::::Event::::::nameSpecificEvent
      Doenst provide execute a lot of times in diferents modules 
      Will just execute one time  at moment are the last 

:::::Event::::::addEventListener
      provide execute a lot of times in !== modules 

:::::simple::::function just one line:::::::

        variable.nameSpecificEvent = () => ModalNameObject.method() 

:::::arrow function ::::function more than just one line

        variable.nameSpecificEvent = (a, b ) => {
          // step by step 
          // step by step 
        }


::::::function more reliageble 

        variable.nameSpecificEvent = Name_Function

        function Name_Function(parameter1 , parameter2 ){
          // step by step 
        }


Using tag script into the block head used defer to just execute it after loaded all elements into the block body tag

It will put in withing the elements together on a center all content

label must be display in block to make margin from the input 

#VERSION 1.0

  #EVENT   

  after click on the button CALCULAR O MEU IMC
    have the result 
    show result
    show modal 
    button turn off modal 



    document = objecto global
    visibility:hidden; change DOM manipulation 

    New code learned
    Pseudoclasses css

    div::placeholder{
      color ---
    }


     transition: background-color .3s;

    create one classes on the css 
    you made first screen 
    After
    edit named that classe into the html to other screen

        
    /*Modal*/

    .modal-wrapper{
      position: absolute;
      /*inset : 0;*/     =    top: 0;  bottom: 0;   right: 0;   left: 0;
    }

    centralizar 

        margin : 23rem auto;
        margin-inline: auto;

        display: flex;   justify-content:center ; align-item: center ;

        display:grid; place-content: center;

        display: grid; place-items: center;

    #Modal Strategity
        creat div .modal for initial opacity : 0 
        create a class .open with atribute opacty : 1 
        |    on javaScript DOM manipulation  classList.toggle(open)
       /\___,have to make on css .modal.open { opacity: 1}   when the class .modal are together .open opacity: 0
       \_________,.modal-wrapper.open{       it means when the element div have both classes change value atribute
                    opacity: 1;
                    visibility: visible;
                  }

    #POP_UP menssage Strategity
          position: relative ;   top,right,left : 0;
          SAME STRATEGITY TO MODAL open


    #MODAL MENSASSE POP-UP DOENS'T WORK

      It dont make transition sllowly

#STEP BY STEP SUBMIT 
    reference form from html into file script as variable
    form
    input1
    input2

    SCRIPT DOM 

    Variable.onEvent = FUNCTION // create events
    diferent way to make this
      1#
        variable.onEvent = function (){   // code }
      2#
        variable.onEvent = () => {   // code }
      3#
        variable.onEvent = NameFUnction 

        function NameFUnction(){ // code }
    gets value from inputs

Modularizing functions diferentes responsabilities

  Put all the variables used to make events and their reactions into a object that represents all about MODAL 
  OBJ ={
    variables 

   name(){
    variabels.events 
   }
  }

  OBJ = {
    variables= event points html

    name:fuctions(){
      OBJ.function_DOM_Manipulation
    }
  }

  OBJ.name()

    This Error was the situation even you are ussing the property from object you still must refrence about what OBJ are this actual property  

    wrapper.classList.add("open");

    getted : 78 167
    modalEx3.js:46 27.97
    modalEx3.js:19 Used Open
    modalEx3.js:20  Uncaught ReferenceError: wrapper is not defined
    at Object.open (modalEx3.js:20:5)
    at form.onsubmit (modalEx3.js:51:9)

    correct 
    Go to the OBJ modal and into the function  before atribute wrapper    put     OBJ referencied

    Modal.wrapper.classList.add("open");


VERSION 1.3
  Aplayed Design Paterns
  -Diferent functions in diferent Places 
  CLOSE MODAL BY CLICKING ON THE KEYBOARD escape  ESC

  Aplying the DOM MANIPULATION
    objeto_Global.onEvent     it means just will execute on time : the last time this line will interpretaded 
    OBJ.addEventListener will repeat a lot of times will called 

  Data Validation 

  using the Constructor function that retuns boolean if the date isn't what i am waitting by the user 
  Used Paterns Design   
  if its not display that first modal from the html
